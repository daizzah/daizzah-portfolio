# 🌸 daizzah.dev — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for [daizzah.dev](https://daizzah.dev) — my personal website and portfolio.  
It’s where I showcase who I am, what I’ve built, and the things I care about as a developer.

## 🌐 Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout
- Font Awesome for icons
- Deployed on Vercel

## 🗂 Pages

- **Home** – Landing page with intro and links
- **About Me** – My coding journey, focus areas, and fun facts
- **Experiences** – A detailed look at my projects and past internship
- **Contact** – A minimal form that fades into a custom thank-you message
- **404 Page** – Custom-designed with gradient background and a back button

## 🎨 Design Style

Pastel palette (soft pinks, purples, and neutrals), rounded corners, and light shadows — all meant to feel clean, personal, and approachable. Fully responsive with scroll animations and mobile-first layout.
